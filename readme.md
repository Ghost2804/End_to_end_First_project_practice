# End-to-End Machine Learning Project

This project implements a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline, guided by insights from Krish Naik. The goal is to follow best practices for building and deploying a machine learning model, utilizing AWS for cloud deployment and leveraging CI/CD pipelines and MLOps for smooth, automated development.

## Project Overview
This project involves:
- **Data ingestion** from various sources.
- **Data transformation** using feature engineering techniques.
- **Model training** using Pythonâ€™s powerful machine learning libraries.
- **Deployment on AWS** to create a scalable and production-ready machine learning service.
- **Version control and collaboration** using GitHub, ensuring reproducibility and efficient teamwork.
- **CI/CD pipelines** to automate the development and deployment process with MLOps principles.

## Prerequisites
To follow this project, familiarity with the following concepts is essential:
- **Python** programming for building machine learning models.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand and preprocess the data.
- **Feature engineering** to create meaningful input features for the model.
- **Basic model training** techniques using popular libraries like scikit-learn.

## Project Setup

### 1. Environment Setup
We use **Conda** for managing the Python environment. To create the required environment, run:
```bash
conda create --name ml_project python=3.8
conda activate ml_project
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

### The project is structured into several key modules, including:
- Data Ingestion: Handles loading raw data from multiple sources.
- Data Transformation: Includes data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Model Training: Builds and trains machine learning models.

### 3. Version Control
Version control is handled using GitHub. We use VS Code for development, which is seamlessly integrated with GitHub. To sync your project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository
```

### making changes in git
```
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
git push origin main
```

### Conclusion

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of modern machine learning practices, from initial data exploration to model deployment. By leveraging tools like AWS, GitHub, and CI/CD, the entire process is streamlined to enable rapid development and deployment in real-world scenarios.
